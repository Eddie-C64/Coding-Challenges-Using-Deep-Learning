# Linear Regression - Predicting animals weight with brain weight

## Overview
The goal is to predict an animal's body weight given it's brain weight. The model we'll be using is called [Linear Regression](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-linear-regression/). The dataset we're using to train our model is a list of brain weight and body weight measurements from a bunch of animals. We'll fit our line to the data using the scikit learn machine learning library, then plot our graph using matplotlib.

## Dependencies

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

You can just run
`pip install -r requirements.txt` 
in terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Here is a link to [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) if you don't already have it.

## Usage

Type `ipython Animal Weight Prediction.ipynb` into terminal and you'll see the scatter plot and line of best fit appear with the coefficents and varaince printed out.

* Bonus points if you perform linear regression on a dataset with 3 different variables*
