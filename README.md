# Coding-Challenges-Using-Deep-Learning
Repository of coding challenges issued by youtube personality and deep learning connoisseur [siraj raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A)
## Coding Challenges include
* [Simple Linear Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_linear_regression) Using Brain Weight we predict body weight.
* [Simple Neural Network: Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron) We build a simple neural network using only numpy.
* [Sentiment Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) Using Natural Language Processing in order to interpret verbel data as positive or negative.
* [Math of Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) Using feedforward network we make it learn using gradient decent.
* [Data Cleaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) Pricipal Component Analysis is how data scientist transform data to see which is most useful for the investigation.
* [Stock Price Predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) Long short-term memory has become one of the most widely used neural networkm here we use it to predict the value of the stock.
* [Making Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning) Style transfer is where you take two seperately learned methods and combine them to create something new, in this case using two image to crete and combine to make art.
* [Kaggle Style Image Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_image_classificationg) Using Keras I train on 10 different animal training sets in order to identify the animals.
